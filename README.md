# NetGuard ML Project

## Overview
NetGuard ML leverages advanced machine learning techniques to enhance network security and efficiency. Focused on dynamic congestion control, the project employs a Random Forest classifier and other algorithms to predict and manage network congestion.

## Components
- **Data Collection**: Scripts for capturing and preprocessing network traffic data.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to monitor network performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and throughput.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analysis of network traffic to detect congestion patterns and security threats.
- **Upload Tasks**: Functionality for uploading data to cloud storage or FTP servers for further processing and analysis.

## Usage
Each script in the respective folders (`Capture`, `Measurements`, `Upload`) is designed for specific tasks within the network monitoring and analysis pipeline. Replace placeholder values with your specific configurations.

## Installation
Ensure the installation of all required Python libraries as per the individual script requirements.
