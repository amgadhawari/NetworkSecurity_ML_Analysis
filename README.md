# NetGuard ML Project

## Overview
NetGuard ML employs advanced machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest classifiers, for enhancing network security and efficiency, particularly focusing on dynamic congestion control.

## Getting Started
To reproduce the results in the report, follow these structured steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, Scapy, ftplib, requests
  - Install using `pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy scapy ftplib requests`

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. **Capture Network Data**: Use the scripts in the `Capture` folder to collect network traffic data.
   ```bash
   python Capture/tcpdump.py
   ```
2. **Preprocess Data**: Utilize preprocessing scripts (if available in the `Preprocessing` folder) to prepare the data for analysis.

### Network Performance Monitoring
- Execute scripts in the `Measurements` folder to gather network performance metrics.
  ```bash
  python Measurements/network_performance_metrics.py
  ```

### Data Analysis
- Analyze the network traffic for patterns related to congestion or security threats.
  ```bash
  python Analysis/network_data_analyzer.py
  ```

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Train the Random Forest classifier and evaluate its performance using the script in the `ModelTraining` folder.
  ```bash
  python ModelTraining/random_forest_classifier.py
  ```

### Reproducing Specific Results
- To replicate specific results or figures presented in the report, run the corresponding analysis or model training scripts with the same dataset and parameters used in the study.

### Upload Results
- For uploading the results or processed data to cloud storage or an FTP server, use scripts in the `Upload` folder.
  ```bash
  python Upload/upload_to_cloud.py
  python Upload/upload_to_ftp.py
  ```
